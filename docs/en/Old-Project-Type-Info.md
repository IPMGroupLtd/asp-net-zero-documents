# Important Notice

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the performance and maintainability of our product, we have made the decision to remove support for ASP.NET MVC 5.x and AngularJS.

### Why the Change?

ASP.NET MVC 5.x still supported by Microsoft, see [details](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/aspnet) but Microsoft suggests ASP.NET Core for new app development as mentioned [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/). Becasue of that, we removed MVC 5.x options from ASP.NET Zero.

### What This Means for You

You can't create ASP.NET MVC 5.x projects from ASP.NET Zero download page but if you still need an MVC 5.x project, please contact with info@aspnetzero.com.


If you already have an existing MVC 5.x project, you can find documentation related to ASP.NET MVC 5.x projects below.
