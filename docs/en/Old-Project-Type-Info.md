# Important Notice

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the performance and maintainability of our product, we have made the decision to remove support for ASP.NET MVC 5.x and AngularJS. This change is part of our strategy to adopt more modern and efficient frameworks.

### Why the Change?

- **Performance Improvements:** Modern frameworks provide better performance and scalability.
- **Security:** Newer frameworks come with improved security features.
- **Maintainability:** Modern frameworks are easier to maintain and extend.
- **Community Support:** More active community support for newer technologies.

### What This Means for You

- **Codebase Update:** If you use custom modules or extend functionality using ASP.NET MVC 5.x or AngularJS, you will need to adapt your code base for new features
- **Migration:** We recommend migrating to more modern frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and Angular.

If you have any questions about the latest version or need further assistance, please feel free to contact our support team.
