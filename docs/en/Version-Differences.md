# Project Types Differences

## Overall
While base functionalities are identical for all versions of ASP.NET Zero, there are still some differences between different versions. In this document, we will highlight these differences.

### ASP.NET Core vs. ASP.NET MVC 5.x
Beginning from [v4.1](https://docs.aspnetzero.com/en/common/latest/Change-Logs), we are more focused on **ASP.NET Core** based solutions (rather than ASP.NET MVC 5.x). That means our new major features will be implemented for ASP.NET Core version.

### Angular vs. Angularjs 1.x
Beginning from [v4.1](https://docs.aspnetzero.com/en/common/latest/Change-Logs), we are more focused on **Angular** based solutions (rather than Angularjs 1.x). That means our new major features will be implemented for Angular framework.

## Version Differences

- **ASP.NET Core & Angular:** Twitter social login option is not available.
