## OpenIddict Integration: Enhancing Authentication and Authorization

As you may know, ASP.NET Zero **ended** using the **Identity Server** as the default authentication and authorization provider in v12.0. However, we've received **feedback** from our customers that they **need to use** a authentication and authorization **provider** that is **lightweight** and easier to configure. That's why we've decided to integrate **OpenIddict**, a simple yet powerful **OpenID Connect** server, into ASP.NET Zero.

Incorporating OpenIddict into ASP.NET Zero v12.3 marks a significant step forward in authentication and authorization. OpenIddict provides a **secure** and efficient solution for handling these **critical aspects**, ensuring that your applications are **fortified against** unauthorized access and data breaches. This **integration** opens up a world of possibilities, allowing you to easily implement **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect protocols**.

## Upgrade to Angular 16: Embracing the Latest Technologies

## Power Tools: Overriding Application Services with Partial Classes
