Power Tools supports [master-detail](https://docs.aspnetzero.com/en/common/latest/Development-Guide-Rad-Tool-Master-Detail) entities, which involve a child-parent relationship and also navigation properties. For these, we have options to choose relations through either a lookup table or a dropdown menu, providing you with greater flexibility. And it is now possible with typeahead (autocomplete) option.
