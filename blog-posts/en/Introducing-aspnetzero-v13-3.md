# Introducing ASP.NET Zero v13.3

We are excited to announce the release of ASP.NET Zero v13.3. This release includes maui developments, recaptcha out of the box, and many other improvements. We have also updated the packages and fixed some bugs. Let's take a look at the new features and improvements.

## üìú Entity Change History

As you may know, ASP.NET Boilerplate includes an entity change history feature. This functionality allows you to track which user made changes to an entity, when those changes were made, and what values were involved. It‚Äôs a powerful tool for viewing the history of an entity and reverting changes as needed.

We have developed a user-friendly interface for this feature, making it easy to view changes and track the history.

## üì± Refactor Maui

We have refactored the Maui project to enhance its stability and user-friendliness. 

* Code enhancements have reduced redundancy, and the project now features a more organized folder structure. This will make it easier for you to navigate the project and find the files you need.

* Form structures now utilize Blazor's original form components. This change will make it easier for you to customize forms and improve the user experience.

* Renamed files and folders have been updated to reflect the new structure.

## üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Recaptcha for Email Activation and Password Reset

We have integrated Recaptcha support for both email activation and password reset processes. This enhancement provides an additional layer of security, helping to protect your application from spam and abuse, ensuring a safer user experience.

## ‚ö° Power Tools: Fix Bugs

We are constantly improving the Power Tools feature based on your feedback. In this version, we have fixed some bugs and made some improvements.

* Fixed file upload problem at Angular non-modal page.

* Fixed file property problems for Excel import.

* Improved datepickers on mvc for better localization.

* Fixed PostreSQL connection on loading entities from the database.
